        "description": "Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown insects that feed on blood, typically at night while people are sleeping. These pests can hide in cracks and crevices around beds, furniture, and other items, making them difficult to detect and eradicate. Bedbug bites can cause itchy welts on the skin and, while they are not known to transmit diseases, their presence can lead to stress and sleep disturbances. Effective elimination often requires professional pest control measures to completely eradicate infestations.",

        "description": "Termites are small, pale insects that feed on wood and other materials containing cellulose. Known as silent destroyers, they can cause extensive damage to wooden structures, furniture, and even books, clothing, and insulation. Their ability to chew through wood often goes unnoticed until significant damage is done. Forming large colonies, termites work silently, making them a challenging pest to detect and control. Professional pest management is usually necessary to effectively eliminate termite infestations and prevent further structural damage.",

They are commonly found in various habitats worldwide, particularly in warm and humid environments. While both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar, it's the female mosquito that requires a blood meal to lay eggs. Their bites can cause itching and, in some cases, transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, and West Nile virus. Mosquito control often involves the elimination of standing water where they breed and can also include the use of repellents and insecticides to reduce their population.",
